How to add a smaller logo for smaller screens:
If you have a logo that is too big for small screens, you could add a mini logo for them.
A logo width of 250px fits fine even on the smallest screen size.
The below instructions are based on using a standard logo with a width of 500px, but you can change it accordingly.
When the screen is minimized to 560px, the standard logo will change to the smaller logo, ensuring that it fits onto the screen.

1) Upload your small logo to the style image folder. (Clean-Boardz/theme/images)
2) Using a text editor open the responsive.css style sheet. (Clean-Boardz/theme/responsive.css)
3) Go to the bottom of the style sheet, on a new line add the following:

/* site logo on small screens */

@media (max-width: 560px) {

.site_logo {

background-image: url("./images/mini_site_logo.png");

width: 250px;

height: 46px;

} }

4) Change the background-image url to your small logo url. (example: "images/mini_site_logo.png" to images/your_logo.png")
5) Change the 250px width and 46px height to the size of your mini logo.
6) Upload the updated responsive.css file.
